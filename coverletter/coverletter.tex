\begin{document}
Dear editors and reviewers,
thanks again for the kind invitation to submit an extension to our previous
paper. Within our previous work we have introduced an averaging model to reduce
the model uncertainty which arises by the need of selecting a sufficient rank
$r$. Therefore, we used a Bayesian model comparison to derive a probability for
each model and fuse the information from all different models into an averaging model. 

Within this extension we set our focus to the interaction between model
uncertainty and data uncertainty, which arises by
measurement noise. Instead of remeasure patients several times we use wild bootstrapping
to simulate noised measurements. From the noise measurements we compute the
averaging and the selection model and investigated the impact of noise to the
primary directions. We use the information from all bootstraps to create a new
model which fuses all bootstraps in a consensus model and reduces the data
uncertainty. Fiber tracking within the new model leads to an significantly
better Dice score compared to the average and selection model. As a baseline
comparison we have used a rank-$3$ model. Also compared to the baseline the new models are
significantly better.

We apologize for the delayed submission. However, we are confident that our new
approach is quiet a bit more than the required 30 \% of new work and the
bootstrap consensus computation was very time intense.
