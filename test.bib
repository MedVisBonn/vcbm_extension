This relationship is used to design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e., water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging, which provides information about tissue microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant.}

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways.}

abstract = {MRI tractography is the mapping of neural fiber pathways based on diffusion MRI of tissue diffusion anisotropy. Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. To address this limitation, diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) and related methods were developed to image complex distributions of intravoxel fiber orientation. Here we demonstrate that tractography based on DSI has the capacity to image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure, following directions of maximum diffusion at every point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets. These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional neuroanatomy.}

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.}

Preliminary analyses based on a finalized set of acquisition and preprocessing protocols demonstrate the exceptionally high quality of the data from each modality. The first quarterly release of imaging and behavioral data via the ConnectomeDB database demonstrates the commitment to making HCP datasets freely accessible. Altogether, the progress to date provides grounds for optimism that the HCP datasets and associated methods and software will become increasingly valuable resources for characterizing human brain connectivity and function, their relationship to behavior, and their heritability and genetic underpinnings.}

Despite widespread use in clinical and research domains, these methods suffer from several potential drawbacks or limitations. Thus, validating the accuracy and reproducibility of techniques is critical for sound scientific conclusions and effective clinical outcomes. Towards this end, a number of international benchmark competitions, or challenges, has been organized by the diffusion MRI community in order to investigate the reliability of the tractography process by providing a platform to compare algorithms and results in a fair manner, and evaluate common and emerging algorithms in an effort to advance the state of the field. In this paper, we summarize the lessons from a decade of challenges in tractography, and give perspective on the past, present, and future challenges that the field of diffusion tractography faces.}

abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global–local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.}

abstract = {The individual course of white matter fiber tracts is an important factor for analysis of white matter characteristics in healthy and diseased brains. Diffusion-weighted MRI tractography in combination with region-based or clustering-based selection of streamlines is a unique combination of tools which enables the in-vivo delineation and analysis of anatomically well-known tracts. This, however, currently requires complex, computationally intensive processing pipelines which take a lot of time to set up. TractSeg is a novel convolutional neural network-based approach that directly segments tracts in the field of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks without using tractography, image registration or parcellation. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is much faster than existing methods while providing unprecedented accuracy, using a population of 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We also show initial evidence that TractSeg is able to generalize to differently acquired data sets for most of the bundles. The code and data are openly available at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg/ and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1088277, respectively.}
